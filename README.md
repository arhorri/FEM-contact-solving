# FEM-contact-solving
This repository implements a 1D finite element analysis of an axially loaded bar with variable cross-section. It compares Lagrange multiplier and penalty methods to enforce a displacement constraint, using vectorized energy calculations for improved performance and providing visualization of force-displacement behavior.
